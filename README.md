Hand written number generation using GAN:-

1) implemented using torchvision and torch
2) mnist data set is used to train the GAN model.
3) binary cross entropy loss matrix is used for both Generator and Discriminator network.
4) after 600 epochs Generator network was able to generate handwritten digit given random noise input.
